# Neural Network Project

## üìå Introduction

This repository contains implementations and experiments with **neural networks**, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced architectures. The goal is to provide a clear learning path through hands-on tasks, allowing a deeper understanding of how neural networks are designed, trained, and applied to real-world problems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components of Neural Networks

The project begins with the **basic building blocks** of neural networks, including:

* **Neurons and activation functions** (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, softmax)
* **Loss functions** for classification and regression
* **Gradient descent and backpropagation** for parameter optimization
* **Regularization** (dropout, weight decay) to prevent overfitting

---

## üß† Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

We implement **fully connected neural networks** (multi-layer perceptrons) from scratch using NumPy and compare them with implementations in frameworks such as **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. Topics include:

* Forward and backward propagation
* Training with different optimizers
* Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
* Evaluation using cross-validation

---

## üñºÔ∏è Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are implemented to handle **image recognition tasks**. The repository demonstrates:

* Convolution and pooling layers
* Feature extraction and hierarchical representation
* Image classification experiments
* Impact of architecture depth and kernel size

## üîÑ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

We explore **sequence modeling** using RNNs and their advanced variants:

* Vanilla RNNs for simple sequence prediction
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
* Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
* Applications in natural language processing (text classification, sequence generation)

---

## üöÄ Advanced Sequence Techniques

Finally, we explore **modern sequence modeling approaches**, including:

* Attention mechanisms
* Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architectures
* Transformer-based models (introductory level)
* Comparison of classical RNNs vs. attention-based methods

---

## üìä Results & Insights

* ANNs perform well on structured data but struggle with images and sequences.
* CNNs significantly improve performance on image classification.
* RNNs capture sequential dependencies but are limited by vanishing gradients.
* Attention mechanisms and Transformers provide state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling.
